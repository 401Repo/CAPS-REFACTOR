# CAPS - refactor version

### Important:

- Moved everything to its own folder so as to better communicate.
- The env has only two bits of info:
    - one is "Cosco" wich im used to make sure my faker info is coming in or
    using my own fake company for default.
    - Port at 3000, but removed them so as to not need a env for now.

### TEST

  Test our vendor generated payload
-    ✓ Our payload is being passed correctly (2 ms)

CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we’ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

### Lab 18 update:

Everything is in its own folder. Testing the payload as it is the one thing we are creating outside of our logger. Updating UML.

### Lab 17 update:

replaced for a socket connection to meet every file in a common port for instant communication.
